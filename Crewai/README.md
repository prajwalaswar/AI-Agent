# 🚀 CrewAI-Powered Intelligent Agents

## 🤖 Overview
Welcome to the **CrewAI-Powered Intelligent Agents** project! This repository showcases how to leverage **CrewAI** for building advanced, multi-agent systems that efficiently collaborate to perform complex tasks. 

CrewAI allows you to define, orchestrate, and execute multiple AI agents working in unison, making it an ideal solution for **automating workflows, intelligent decision-making, and task delegation.**

## 🎯 Features
- 🔹 **Multi-Agent Collaboration** – Define teams of AI agents that work together.
- 🔹 **Task Automation** – Automate decision-making and task execution.
- 🔹 **CrewAI Integration** – Harness the power of **CrewAI** for seamless agent coordination.
- 🔹 **Extendable & Scalable** – Easily customize agents and scale workflows.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crewai_project.git
cd crewai_project

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
Run the main script to start the CrewAI system:
```bash
python main.py
```

Modify the `agents/` and `tasks/` directories to define your custom AI agents and workflows.

## 📌 Example Workflow
1. **Define Agents** – Specify agent roles, personalities, and capabilities.
2. **Assign Tasks** – Allocate tasks to the appropriate agents.
3. **Run CrewAI** – Observe agents collaborating to complete tasks intelligently.
