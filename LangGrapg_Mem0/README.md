# Mem0 Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Mem0.ipynb`) demonstrating memory management concepts, data persistence, and implementation examples in Python.

## 📘 Overview

This notebook explores and demonstrates key ideas around memory persistence, caching, and AI memory mechanisms.

## 📂 Notebook Sections
- create client
- → {'message': 'Memory updated successfully!'}
- Install the necessary library
- Initialize the Google Generative AI chat model
- Recreate the index on user_id

## 🧠 Key Features
- Demonstrates in-memory vs persistent memory management.
- Implements memory store for conversational or agentic AI applications.
- Uses Python libraries for data storage and retrieval.
- Shows examples with clear explanations and outputs.

## ⚙️ Requirements
Install dependencies before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or directly install Jupyter if not available:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Mem0.ipynb
   ```
2. Run all cells sequentially to see the demonstration.

## 🧩 Author Notes

This notebook was likely used to prototype **memory persistence mechanisms** useful for **agentic AI** or **retrieval-augmented systems**.
